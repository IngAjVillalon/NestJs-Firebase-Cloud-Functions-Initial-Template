# Welcome to NestJs-Firebase-Cloud-Functions-Template!
A template for a new nestjs project configured to be able to upload to cloud functions of firebase

Steps to follow to work on this template:

 1. Clone this repository
 2. Set up your firebase project with: `firebase init`
 3. Change to the functions folder `cd ./functions/`
 4. Install all dependencies `npm intall`
 5. Do a local test with the firebase local server `npm run serve` so you can see that everything is fine.
 6. Once you see it running without errors in your local environment, take the project to the server `npm run deploy`
 7. **Start the development of your back end using nestJs:** `Npm run start: dev`
